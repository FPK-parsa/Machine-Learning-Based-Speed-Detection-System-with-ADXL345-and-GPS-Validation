# Machine Learning Speed Detection System

## Project Description
This project aims to estimate speed using acceleration data collected from the ADXL345 accelerometer module. The speed labels for training and validation were recorded using the GPS NEO-M8 module. Various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and others, were employed in the project. Additionally, a Neural Network model was used to enhance the predictions further. This approach demonstrates the potential of machine learning in deriving speed without direct GPS dependency.
