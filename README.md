Machine Learning-Based Speed Detection System
Using ADXL345 and GPS Validation
Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based system to detect speed using acceleration data from the ADXL345 sensor and validates the results using GPS data. The goal is to develop a robust and efficient model to calculate speed in real-time scenarios, especially for applications in vehicles, robotics, and similar fields.

Features
Sensor Integration: Utilizes the ADXL345 accelerometer to collect precise acceleration data.
Machine Learning Model: A trained model processes acceleration features to estimate speed accurately.
GPS Validation: Speed estimates are validated against GPS-provided speed data for accuracy.
Data Processing Pipeline: Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
Python Implementation: Fully implemented in Python for flexibility and ease of use.
How It Works
Data Collection: Acceleration data is collected using the ADXL345 module, while GPS data is logged simultaneously.
Feature Engineering: Relevant features are extracted from raw acceleration data for training.
Model Training: A machine learning algorithm (e.g., regression, neural network) is trained to map acceleration to speed using the GPS speed as ground truth.
Validation: The trained model's predictions are compared with GPS data to evaluate accuracy.
